Citi Bike Analytics  -Citi Bike 2015

Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike Data webpage：https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data  。 

Ideally, I wished use all data and compare the data in different years. However, It takes too much to load the data and it is imposible to update to the web with such large dataset. I decided to use only one year data. Finally, I chose 2015 due to the 2015 data. Please use the following link to download the data. of course, the data is too big and it is not able to upload to github. Please use the follow link to download data.
